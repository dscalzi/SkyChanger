*/
public void skychangerTests(Player player) {
    // Get a reference to the API.
    final SkyAPI api = SkyChanger.getAPI();

    // Change the sky and save the result.
    // Equivalent to /SkyChanger 3
    boolean result1 = api.changeSky(SkyChanger.wrapPlayer(player), SkyPacket.RAIN_LEVEL_CHANGE, 3F);

    if(result1) {
        player.sendMessage("Why did the sky turn red?");
    }

    // Equivalent to /SkyChanger 4 8
    boolean result2 = api.changeSky(SkyChanger.wrapPlayer(player), SkyPacket.RAIN_LEVEL_CHANGE, 4F)

    if(result2) {
        player.sendMessage("Why did the sky turn light blue?");
